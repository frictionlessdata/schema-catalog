title: Table Schema Catalog
description: The website for the catalog should have all the features needed such as full-text search and filtered search (by country, etc.). It should also have an API to make use of the catalog within other tools, for example, an open data portal proposing schemas when people upload a data package. This is an idea already experimented by ODI with Octopub.
